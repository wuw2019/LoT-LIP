    Understanding long text is of great demands in practice but beyond the reach of most language-image pre-training (LIP) models.
In this work, we empirically confirm that the key reason causing such an issue is that the training images are usually paired with short captions, leaving certain tokens easily overshadowed by salient tokens.
Towards this problem, our initial attempt is to relabel the data with <strong>long captions</strong>, however, directly learning with which may lead to performance degradation in understanding short text (<em>e.g.</em>, in the image classification task).
Then, after incorporating corner tokens to aggregate diverse textual information, we manage to help the model catch up to its original level of short text understanding yet greatly enhance its capability of long text understanding.
We further look into whether the model can continuously benefit from longer captions and notice a clear trade-off between the performance and the efficiency.
Finally, we validate the effectiveness of our approach using a self-constructed large-scale dataset, which consists of <strong>100M</strong> long caption oriented text-image pairs.
It is noteworthy that, on the task of long-text image retrieval, we beat the competitor using long captions with 11.1% improvement (<em>i.e.</em>, from 72.62% to 83.72%).
We will release the code, the model, and the new dataset to facilitate the reproducibility and further research.

The podium is equipped with a microphone, amplifying his voice to the audience. The audience is seated in rows of chairs, attentively facing the man and the podium. The room is well-lit, with several lights mounted on the ceiling. Adding a touch of nature to the indoor setting, there are several potted plants scattered around the room.

        <strong>The impacts of long <em>v.s.</em> short captions on image-language pre-training.</strong>
        Training with short text-image pairs leaves certain tokens (<em>e.g.</em>, garden token) easily overshadowed by salient tokens (<em>e.g.</em>, castle token).
        long captions-image pairs can help bring the overshadowed tokens back into the light.

        <p style="font: size 20px; text-align: justify;">
          As the length of text (the number of sub-captions) increases, the performance of the pre-trained model on long-text-image retrieval
          consistently improves and becomes stable. However, there is degradation in the retrieval task and classification when the
          model is trained with longer text.

            In order to find a solution that well balances both long and short texts, we design to add extra text tokens for text encoders, termed corner tokens  ([Cor 1], [Cor 2], . · · · ), to aggregate diverse text features.
